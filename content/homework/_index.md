{{%notice note%}}
Homeworks are due **Fridays on 8pm** via Gradescope, unless announced otherwise. A brief video tutorial
is available [here](https://www.gradescope.com/get_started).
<br><br>
You can submit work as a series of photos of your handwritten notes or as a single PDF, either
exported from a note-taking app, scanned, or created by combining photos of your handwritten notes (there 
are free apps available on all major mobile operating systems for creating "scans" from photos). 
**Please start each problem on a new page!**
<br><br>
To limit access, the solutions to the homeworks will be made available through the GitLab materials 
repository but not through the website. **Please do not distribute the solutions.**
