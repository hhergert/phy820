There will be three or four computational projects over the course of the semester. Please check back for details. In the mean time, please get gamiliar with the operation of `git`, Python and Jupyter, and complete the tutorial below.

## Jupyter Tutorial

This [tutorial](../computation/python/jupyter_intro.ipynb) demonstrates much of the functionality of Jupyter that will be used throughout the course.

## Projects

Due dates for a first draft of the project are indicated in the table. As mentioned in class, we will iterate the
projects via GitLab.

| 	   | Name 											 | File                         | Draft Due |
|------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| P01  | Pendulum 		   				                 | [Jupyter](p01_pendulum.ipynb) | 10/11     |
| P02  | Solar System Simulator 		   				 | [Jupyter](p02_solar_system.zip)   | 11/17    |
| P03  | Nonlinear Oscillators 		   				     | [Jupyter](p03_nonlinear_oscillator.zip)   | 12/10  |


{{%notice tip%}}
Certain browsers will save Jupyter notebooks with an additional `.txt` extension - the files are intact, just rename them in order to do your work.
