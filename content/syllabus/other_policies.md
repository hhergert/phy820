## Technology and Media


### Course Recordings, Intellectual Property and Social Media Use 

Meetings of this course may be recorded. The recordings may be available to students registered for this class. This is intended to supplement the classroom experience. Students are expected to follow appropriate University policies and maintain the security of passwords used to access recorded lectures. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not in the class, or uploaded to other online environments. Doing so may result in disciplinary action. If the instructor or another University office plan other uses for the recordings beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent prior to such use.

## Student Expectations

**The All-University Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades:** <br>
All participants in this class are held to the standard set by MSU’s Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades. The policy can be read in full at the [MSU Ombudsperson’s website](http://splife.studentlife.msu.edu/regulations/selected/integrity-of-scholarship-and-grades).


**Spartan Code of Honor:** <br>
On March 22, 2016, The Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) adopted the following Spartan Code of Honor:

>*"As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.”*


**Chosen Name and Pronoun Policy:** <br> 
All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. Many people do not identify with the name on their birth certificate, school ID, or other forms of identification. In this class, I will include the opportunity for students to indicate the name and the pronouns they use. If you would like to change your name, you can do that through StuInfo. Your gender marker can be changed by filing a request at the Office of the Registrar at the Hannah Administration Building. More information about MSU’s preferred name policy can be found at: https://lbgtrc.msu.edu/trans-msu/msu-preferred-name-policy/​. I will do my best to respect students by using the correct name and pronouns for them. Please advise me at any point if you need to update your name and/or pronouns in my records.


**Americans with Disabilities Act Accommodations:** <br>
Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at 517-884-RCPD or on the web at http://rcpd.msu.edu. Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued a verified individual services accommodation (“VISA”) form. Please present this form to me at the start of the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (test, project, etc). Requests received after this date will be honored whenever possible.


**Grief Absences and Mental Health:** <br>
If a student experiences death of a family member or emotional distress from a similar tragedy, refer to MSU's [Grief Absense Policy](https://msu.edu/unit/ombud/classroom-policies/index.html#GriefAbsencePolicy). 

College students often experience issues that may interfere with academic success such as academic stress, sleep problems, juggling responsibilities, life events, relationship concerns, or feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, or depression. If you or a friend is struggling, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Helpful, effective resources are available on campus, and most are at no-charge.

* If you are struggling with this class, please visit during office hours or contact me by email.
* Meet with your academic advisor if you are struggling in multiple classes, unsure whether you are making the most of your time at MSU, or unsure what academic resources are available at MSU.
* Visit https://caps.msu.edu for online health assessments, hours, and additional information.
* Drop by Counseling & Psychiatric Services (CAPS) main location for a same-day mental health screening. (3rd floor of Olin Health Center at 463 E. Circle Drive)

* 24-Hour MSU Sexual Assault Crisis Line (517) 372-6666 or visit https://centerforsurvivors.msu.edu/.

**Policy on Religious Observance** <br>
It is the [policy of MSU](https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Notices/ReligiousPolicy.aspx) to permit students to observe holidays set aside by their chosen religious faith. If you absent yourself from class on your religious holiday, please make arrangements with me in advance.
