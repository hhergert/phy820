<!-- # Computation -->
-------------------

The main computatioal tools for the course are

* **Zoom** and **Slack** for communication (see links in sidebar),

* **Git** for version control and submitting homeworks via MSU's [GitLab instance](http://gitlab.msu.edu),

* and **Jupyter/Python** for numerical exercises and plotting.

In addition, it is recommended to use a computer algebra system for symbolic manipulations during homeworks, e.g., **Mathematica**. The Python distribution we are using contains the **SymPy** package which aims to provide the same functionality, but it is still lacking some capabilities.

More information and tutorials can be found in the following subsections.
