{{%notice note%}}
These are the worksheets for our class meetings. They contain additional notes on the
material that may be useful, especially with an eye on the group exercises and the
homework problems for the week. 
<br><br>
We may not always be able to get through all of the group exercises for a week
during our class meetings. In this case, I strongly encourage you to try and finish
up the work on your own, or rather in your study group -- this will be valuable for
deepening your understanding of the material, and useful for practice. **You
do not have to turn this work in, but I am happy to provide feedback.** 
<br><br>
Solutions to the group exercsies will also be made available through the GitLab 
repository -- I aim to post them by Wednesday of the following week. **Please do 
not distribute the solutions.**

Certain browsers will save Jupyter notebooks with an additional `.txt` extension - the files are intact, just rename them in order to do your work.
