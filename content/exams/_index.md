## Time and Location

There will be two midterms that will cover specific parts of the course (see [schedule page for dates]({{< ref "schedule/_index.md" >}})) and a comprehensive final on **Wednesday, Dec 15, at 7:45am**.

There will be separate versions of the final: For **PHY422** students, the final will be **two hours**,
while the PHY820 version will be designed for **three hours**.


## Subject Exam

The PHY820 final exam functions as a **subject exam** within the departmental graduate degree requirements.
To this end, a separate grade based on this subject exam alone will be provided as well.


## Policies

Exams will be **closed book and closed notes**. In general, you are expected to remember essential equations and how to 
use them. **A formula sheet will be provided** and posted online before the exam. You should bring along a simple calculator 
that has no capability of storing and recalling formulas. **No other electronic devices are allowed during the exams**. Hats are not allowed at the exams either. 

**Documented medical (or other) excuses for midterm exams** will be considered on a case by case basis, and may involve a 
written or oral make-up exam. 

The **MSU Final Examination Policy** states that 

>_Students unable to take a final examination because of illness or other reason over which they have no control should notify the assistant deans of their colleges  immediately._ 

and 

>_A student absent from a final examination without a satisfactory explanation will receive a grade of 0.0_.

## Formula Sheet

The formula sheet provided with the subject exam can be found [here](formula.pdf). It contains more information
than you will need. **Please let me know if you find typos or other mistakes.**

## Practice Materials

#### Previous Subject Exams

The Department of Physics & Astronomy maintains a collection of previous subject exams [here]( 
https://pa.msu.edu/academics/graduate-program/current-graduate-students/practice-exams/). 

#### Practice Problems for Midterms and Subject Exams

{{%notice note%}}
To limit access, the solutions to the practice problems will only be available through the GitLab materials 
repository. **Please do not distribute these materials.** <br><br>
Also note that the length of these problems is **not** a proper indicator for the length of problems on
the actual exams.
