## Current Announcements
<b>October 18, 2021</b><br>
Added solutions for worksheet #7 to the repository, and corrected some typos on [worksheet #8]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}) (available here and through the repo). 

<b>October 14, 2021</b><br>
[Homework #7]({{< ref "/homework/_index.md" >}}) and [worksheet #8]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}) have been added to the website and the repository. 

<b>October 8, 2021</b><br>
[Homework #6]({{< ref "/homework/_index.md" >}}) and a first version of [worksheet #7]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}) have been added to the website and the repository. The worksheet is still missing the final step of the proof for Bertrand's theorem (see e.g. Lemos' book). I am trying out some alternative ideas for the proof and might restructure section 2.3 a bit as a consequence - stay tuned.


<b>September 29, 2021</b><br>
Fixed some typos on [worksheets #4 and #5]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}), and added [worksheet #6]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}) along with a Jupyter demo for the cycloidal pendulum (try it out!). 

Added more worksheet and homework solutions to the repository - the goal is to add as many as possible by early
next week.

**Note:** There will be no homework #5 on Friday to free up time for the midterm preparation. I strongly encourage you to go over all the group exercises, especially the ones you haven't finished yourself. If you're unsure about your approach or the material don't hesitate to come to office hours or to reach out - the sooner, the better. 

You can also give the first batch of [exam preparation problems]({{< ref "/exams/_index.md" >}}) a try: P1-6 are about the material we went through, and you can try constructing Lagrangians for P16-P19 without going into the calculation of normal modes. Solutions to these problems are available in the repository in the folder `exams/prep`.

<b>September 24, 2021</b><br>
A slightly updated  [worksheet #4]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}), the new [worksheet #5]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}) as well as [homework #4]({{< ref "/homework/_index.md" >}}) are available through the website and the repository. The solution for homework #1 is also available in the repo now. 

<b>September 20, 2021</b><br>
The solution to worksheet #3 is already available in the repository, if you want to review the derivation of geodesics using variational calculus. I also fixed some minor issues on [worksheet #4]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}) 
that came up during class today.


<b>September 17, 2021</b><br>
**Late update:** Added the template for the first [computational project]({{< ref "/projects/_index.md" >}}) to the website and the GitLab repository.

[Worksheet #4]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}) and [homework #3]({{< ref "/homework/_index.md" >}}) have been added to the website and the repository. The solution for worksheet #2 is also available through the repo. 

Homework solutions will be added to the repository within 1-2 weeks after the due date, depending on whether any extensions are in place, and how close we are to a midterm (the goal is to make as many solutions as possible available to help you prepare.) 


<b>September 10, 2021</b><br>
The [worksheet]({{< ref "/material/worksheets.md" >}}) and [homework]({{< ref "/homework/_index.md" >}}) for next week have been added to the website and the repository. The solution for worksheet #1 is also available through the repo. (Worksheet solutions will be added on Wednesdays.)

My office hours will be **M 2-4pm, W 1:30-3pm** and **F 2-4pm** until further notice. You can find me in office 2105 in the FRIB building. (If you are not an FRIB student, check in with the receptionist, they will notify me.)

<b>September 7, 2021</b><br>
Reminder: We will meet in **BPS 1420 on Sep 8th**, but starting the week of Sep 13th, our meeting rooms will be STEM 2202 on Mondays, and PSS A149 on Wednesdays and Fridays.

**Please reply to the office hour poll in the Slack channel!** (On that note, we are still missing a few folks on Slack, as well as the GitLab repository.) 


<b>September 1, 2021</b><br>
**The meeting room for Fridays has moved to PSS A149** (Plant & Soil Science Bldg.). This is the same room used by PHY 851 - Quantum Mechanics in the subsequent time slot. I am trying to secure the same room for future Wednesday meetings, please check back!

More updates and fixes to the website. Email invitations for the GitLab repositories and the Slack channel have been sent.

<b>August 31, 2021</b><br>
Website update for FS21 is in progress - check back periodically. In the mean time, you can find the website for
the FS20 version of the course [here](https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~hergert/phy820_fs20).
